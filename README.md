# Core Features

<div align="left">
  <img width="800" src="https://github.com/juanroldan1989/color-tracking/blob/main/color-tracking-screenshot.png" />
</div>

1. Track `hover` and `click` user events.

2. Record data either in `real time` or through `background processing`.

3. Display data through `dashboards` as close to real time as possible.

## Idea inception

<div align="left">
  <img width="400" src="https://github.com/juanroldan1989/color-tracking/blob/main/color-tracking.jpeg" />
</div>

## Best UX implementation

1. `Click/Hover` event triggered in `frontend` app.

2. **Frontend business logic** updates dashboards for current user in `real time` based on user actions.

3. Events data generated is **processed and persisted in real-time** in the backend (`ActionColor` table).

4. Dashboards data is shared among all `frontend` apps via `websockets`.

5. Pros for this approach:

- **All users** receiving live data in real time.
- Whenever a user **refreshes** the page, backend API provides **data up to date** and
- Dashboards display **accurate data** for **all users** at **all times**.

5. Cons of this approach:

- Lots of business logic within frontend app to update dashboards in real time. It needs to be implemented properly to be maintainable in the future.
- More infrastructure needed to sustain real time behavior. (more expensive)

## 2nd Best UX implementation

1. `Click/Hover` event triggered in `frontend` app.

2. **Frontend business logic** updates dashboards in `real time` based on user actions.

3. Events data generated is **processed and persisted in real-time** in the backend (`ActionColor` table).

4. Pros for this approach:

- UX is amazing.
- Whenever user **refreshes** the page,
- Backend API provides **data up to date** and
- Dashboards display **accurate data**

5. Cons of this approach:

- Lots of business logic within frontend app to update dashboards in real time. It needs to be implemented properly to be maintainable in the future.
- If **record creation fails** in backend, dashboards won't match users actions after page reload.
- UI is updated in real time **only for the current user**. Other live users won't be able to see dashboards updates in real time.

## 3rd Best UX implementation

1. `Click/Hover` event triggered in `frontend` app.

2. **Frontend business logic** updates dashboards in `real time` based on user actions.

3. Events data generated is **processed and stored in batches** (less expensive) in the backend (`ActionColor` table).

4. This means:

- Whenever user **refreshes** the page,
- Backend API does not provide **up to date data**,
- Therefore Dashboards in Frontend **might not display accurate data**

5. The above situation can be compensated by:

- Using **frontend streaming bussiness logic** (current implementation)
- To keep dashboards **as much up to date as possible**

### 4th Best UX Implementation

1. `Click/Hover` event triggered in `frontend`
2. Event sent to `backend`
3. `ActionColor` record is created
4. Dashboards data is sent back to `frontend` via `websockets`
5. Dashboards updated accordingly in `frontend`

**Pros:**

- Frontend business logic reduced to a minimum.
- Data displayed always matches records in database, even after page reload.
- UI updated for `all clients` with given API Key.

**Cons:**

- UX is less performant than `Approach 1`

:white_check_mark: This approach has been implemented.

### 5th Best UX Implementation

1. `Click/Hover` event triggered in `frontend`
2. Event sent to `backend`
3. `ActionColor` record is created
4. Dashboards data is fetched from `frontend` via `polling` every X seconds
5. Dashboards updated accordingly in `frontend`

**Pros:**

- Frontend business logic reduced to a minimum.
- Data displayed always matches records in database, even after page reload.
- UI updated for `1 client` with given API Key after X seconds.

**Cons:**

- UX is less performant than `Approach 2`
- Backend API to be closely followed for throtlling issues given the amount of extra requests (polling) sent out.

:white_check_mark: This approach has been implemented.

```ruby
$ cd frontend
$ open index.html
```

## ![Terraform](https://img.shields.io/badge/terraform-%235835CC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=terraform&logoColor=white)

Relevant folder: `/backend/infrastructure/terraform`

1. Enable `Docker Local Development` section in `main.tf`

2. Run commands:

```ruby
$ terraform init

$ terraform plan

$ terraform apply
```

**Application is ready**

Open static `frontend` page:

```ruby
$ cd frontend
$ open index.html
```

To destroy all local containers managed by your Terraform configuration:

```ruby
$ terraform destroy
```

# Testing

## Backend

API tests written with RSpec

```ruby
$ cd backend
$ rspec spec
```

## Frontend

Frontend work has been **purposely** implemented using standalone libraries:

- jQuery (Easy DOM Handling)
- D3 (Graphs)
- Action Cable (Websockets)

```ruby
â”€â”€ frontend
    â””â”€â”€ static
        â”œâ”€â”€ css
        â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.css
        â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
        â””â”€â”€ js
            â”œâ”€â”€ draw_colors_table.js
            â”œâ”€â”€ events
            â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ clicks_and_hovers.js
            â”œâ”€â”€ polling
            â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ draw_clicks_dashboard.js
            â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ draw_hovers_dashboard.js
            â””â”€â”€ websockets
                â”œâ”€â”€ action_cable.js
                â”œâ”€â”€ draw_clicks_dashboard.js
                â””â”€â”€ draw_hovers_dashboard.js
```

This way anyone can use their framework of choice to implement a `frontend` application that interacts with the `backend` and write `frontend` tests as well.

## Docker Containers

Automated Verification achieved through `Chef InSpec`

Chef InSpec is an infrastructure security and compliance testing framework with a human- and machine-readable language for comparing actual versus desired system state.

Download and install Inspec: https://www.chef.io/downloads/tools/inspec

Source: https://joachim8675309.medium.com/docker-the-terraform-way-a7c16b5f59ed

## CI/CD Integration

TODO: Provide Github Actions setup for triggering all frontend/backend and containers tests, THEN deploy.

```ruby
$ cd backend

$ docker-compose up

$ cd backend/infrastructure/tests

$ inspec exec validate_containers_state.rb
```

# Deployment

## ![AWS ECS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-%23FF9900.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)

1. Official steps for ECS CLI Configuration:
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_CLI_installation.html

2. Place both `ecs-cli.asc` and `public_key_ecs.txt` files inside `backend/infrastructure/aws-ecs` folder.

3. Login into AWS Console -> EC2 -> Key pairs -> Create key pair

4. Download `private-ecs-key.cer` and place it inside `backend/infrastructure/aws-ecs` folder

5. Deployment instructions:

```ruby
backend/infrastructure/aws-ecs/setup-aws-ecs.sh
```

This script takes care of:

- Cluster configuration and creation

```ruby
$ ecs-cli configure --region us-east-1 --cluster color-tracking --config-name color-tracking
```

- ECS Key Pair configuration, EC2 Instance Types and Cluster capability

```ruby
$ ecs-cli up --keypair ecs --capability-iam --size 2 --instance-type t3.medium --cluster-config color-tracking --force
```

- ECS Deployment of tasks with containers

```ruby
$ ecs-cli compose up --cluster color-tracking --create-log-groups
```

- Check containers status

```ruby
$ ecs-cli ps --cluster color-tracking
```

6. Cluster deletion and resources cleanup

```ruby
$ ecs-cli down --cluster color-tracking --force
```

## ![Terraform](https://img.shields.io/badge/terraform-%235835CC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=terraform&logoColor=white)

Relevant folder: `/backend/infrastructure/terraform`

1. Enable `AWS DEPLOYMENT` section in `main.tf`

2. Run commands:

```ruby
$ terraform init

# Observe all resources to be added
$ terraform plan

# Build & Launch infrastructure required
$ terraform apply
```

**Application is ready**

Replace `http://localhost:3000` instances inside `frontend/static/index.html` file with `Public DNS` hostname:

1. Check AWS ECS console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home#/clusters

2. Get `Public DNS` value provided within `ECS Cluster` -> `Container Instance` -> `Public DNS`

3. Open static `frontend` page:

```ruby
$ cd frontend
$ open index.html
```

To destroy all remote objects managed by your Terraform configuration:

```ruby
$ terraform destroy
```

# Frontend

Frontend work has been **purposely** implemented using standalone libraries:

- jQuery (Easy DOM Handling)
- D3 (Graphs)
- Action Cable (Websockets)

This way anyone can use their framework of choice to implement a `frontend` application that interacts with the `backend`

# Backend

Broadcasting Events from `backend` to `frontend`

- Websockets implementation in the `backend` achieved through Rails's own `ActionCable`

- Websockets implementation in the `frontend` achieved through `action_cable` Javascript library.

## Database Implementation

Main tables to interact with:

### User

- `api_key`: String

### Colors

- `id`: Integer
- `name`: String (e.g.: "blue", "red")

### Actions

- `id`: Integer
- `name`: String (e.g.: "hover", "click")

### ActionColors

- `id`: Integer
- `api_key`: String
- `action_id`: Integer (e.g.: "Click")
- `color_id`: Integer (e.g.: "Red")
- `amount`: Integer (e.g.: "30")

### Cable Ready (Optional)

`cable_ready` ruby gem is a great extension on `ActionCable` capabilities

Provides `operations` to be broadcasted to the frontend.

https://cableready.stimulusreflex.com/cableready-everywhere

`Backend` adjustments when working with `cable_ready`:

```ruby
# Gemfile

...

gem "cable_ready", "~> 4.5.0"

...
```

```ruby
# /v1/events_controller.rb
...

cable_ready[stream].console_log(message: { results: results })
cable_ready.broadcast

...
```

`Frontend` adjustments when working with `cable_ready`:

```ruby

# js/websockets/draw_hovers_dashboard.js
...

console.log("Received data: ", data);

var results = data.operations.consoleLog[0].message.results;

...
```
